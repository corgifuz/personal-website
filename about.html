            <p>Gillian March Cochran (She/They)</p>

            <br>

            <p>Gillian March is a queer musician and artist from the Philadelphia area. In their personal works they pull inspiration from their love of video games, folk music, and studies of mental health. While she is primarily a musician, she has plans to expand her creative landscape to web design, video game design/composing, and electronic engineering. March is first and foremost a vocalist, but enjoys playing guitar and bass guitar.</p>

            <br>

            <p>March has only publicly shared a handful of her works through BandCamp and SoundCloud, links to both can be found below!</p>
